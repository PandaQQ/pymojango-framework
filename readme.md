# About: framework-pymojango
Integration of Django with MongoDB using PyMongo later implement REST API to talk to frontend of the code.  
  
## Pre-requisites:
- command-prompt
- [python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An IDE (PyCharm preferred)
- Patience

## Getting-Started:
- Open Command-Prompt by typing CMD on **RUN**(Win_Key + R) or in your preferred dir.
- `mkdir <folder-name>`  (give a folder-name and this is optional and **not** recommended)
- `django-admin startproject <project-name>`  (start django project)
- `cd <project-name>`  (access the dir to start working)
- Create a virtual environment by typing `python -m venv <environment-name>`
- Activate the `environment` by typing `venv\scripts\activate`. You'll see `(environment-name)` written in before the path in **cmd**.
- After activating the `environment`, install the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/pixincreate/framework-pymojango/blob/main/requirements.txt) by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- `python manage.py startapp <app-name>`  (create an app)
- `type nul> utils.py` (make sure that `utils.py` file exists where `manage.py` exist)
- `type nul> readme.md` (to keep a documentation of what you're doing)
- `git init`  (initialise git repo)
- Put the following commands to set-up a git-repo on GitHub (in case the repo doesn't exist in prior)
  ```commandline
    echo "# <repo-name>" >> README.md           :: Creted a readme.md file with repo-name in 1st line.
    git init
    git add README.md                           :: Tracks the file
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<user-name>>/<git-repo-name>.git
    git push -u origin main                     :: Pushes the commits to repo
    ``` 
- Put the following commands to push to git-repo on GitHub (in case the repo does exist in prior)
    ```commandline
    git remote add origin https://github.com/pixincreate/blah.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main                     :: Pushes the commits to repo
    ```

### [NOTE:] 
As previously observed, many issues arised upon execution [_Latest fixes are not tested_]. However, `this_code_here_works.py` situated in `./test` folder that has everything **unified** runs without any hassle or error.
